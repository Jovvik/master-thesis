\chapter{Introduction}

Modern datasets often contain geometric or structural relationships that are
poorly captured by traditional statistical methods. Topological data analysis
(TDA) addresses this by computing \textit{persistent homology}, a multiscale
descriptor of connectivity, holes, and higher-dimensional voids. A critical step
in TDA is constructing a filtration of topological spaces from data, often via
real-valued functions that reflect data density.

A natural approach is to define a generalized density function (GDF)
$f(P, x) : \mathcal{P}(X) \times X \to \R$, where $P$ is a dataset.
We can then consider the \textit{sublevelset filtration} of $f$ to analyze the
topological features of $P$ at different scales.
For example, the nearest-neighbor distance function
$f(P, x) = \min_{p \in P} d(x, p)$ is a GDF that captures the distance from a
point $x$ to its nearest point in $P$. The sublevelset filtration of this
function is precisely the \v{C}ech filtration of $P$, which can be intuitvely
described as the process of growing balls around each point in $P$.
The \textit{persistence diagram} of the \v{C}ech filtration is \textit{stable}
with respect to the Hausdorff distance between datasets, that is
\begin{equation}
    d_b(\dgm_{f(P)}, \dgm_{f(Q)}) \leq d_H(P, Q),
\end{equation}
where $d_b$ is the bottleneck distance, a metric on persistence diagrams.
This stability property is crucial for TDA, as it ensures that small
perturbations in the data lead to small changes in the persistence diagrams,
which provides robustness to noise.

A natural question arises: which GDFs yield persistence diagrams that are stable?
Formally, we say that a GDF $f$ is $c$-\textit{stable} if for all datasets
$P, Q \subseteq X$,
\begin{equation}
    d_b(\dgm_{f(P)}, \dgm_{f(Q)}) \leq c \cdot d_H(P, Q).
\end{equation}
